# Paper2Data Web Demo - Deployment Success âœ…

## ðŸŽ‰ Successfully Deployed!

**Live URL:** https://paper2data-production.up.railway.app

## âœ… What Was Fixed

### Issue Identified
- The initial deployment failed because the Dockerfile was hardcoded to port 8000
- Railway automatically assigns a dynamic PORT environment variable (8080 in our case)
- The application wasn't binding to the correct port

### Solution Applied
Updated the Dockerfile CMD to use Railway's dynamic PORT environment variable:
```dockerfile
# Before:
CMD ["uvicorn", "main_simple:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]

# After:
CMD ["sh", "-c", "uvicorn main_simple:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port ${PORT:-8000}"]
```
