their ability to capture higher-order relationships within larger
groups of instances.
To address this challenge, recent works have introduced
N-tuple weak supervision to handle group-wise relations.
For example, N-tuple comparison learning (NT-Comp) [22]
assumes a ranking over the N instances in each tuple based on
their probabilities of being positive, providing richer ordinal
