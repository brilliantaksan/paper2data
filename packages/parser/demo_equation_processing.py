    Abstract
    
    This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of mathematical relationships.
    The fundamental equation E = mc² (1) demonstrates the mass-energy equivalence.
    
    Introduction
    
    Newton's second law F = ma (2) is a cornerstone of classical mechanics.
    The relationship between force, mass, and acceleration is crucial for understanding motion.
    
    Methods
    
    We analyze the integral ∫₀¹ x²dx = 1/3 to determine the area under the curve.
    The summation ∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ aᵢ represents the total of all elements.
    
    Results
    
    The probability formula P(A) = n(A)/n(S) shows the ratio of favorable outcomes.
    Angular relationships α = β + γ demonstrate geometric principles.
    
    Discussion
    
    As shown in Equation (1), the mass-energy relationship is fundamental.
    Equation (2) provides the basis for our analysis.
    The results from Eq. 1 and Eq. 2 are consistent with theoretical predictions.
