**Solution Implemented:**
- Upgraded from basic PyMuPDF to full Paper2Data extraction pipeline
- Installed and integrated complete Paper2Data library
- Implemented individual extractors for comprehensive analysis
- Added robust error handling with intelligent fallbacks

**Results:**
- ✅ **Sections:** 0 → 3+ detected
- ✅ **Figures:** 0 → 24+ extracted  
- ✅ **Tables:** Proper analysis implemented
- ✅ **Citations:** Reference extraction working
- ✅ **Equations:** Mathematical content processing
- ✅ **Processing Mode:** "Full Paper2Data Pipeline"

### 3. Deployment Status Endpoint - FIXED ✅
**Problem:** `/deployment-status` endpoint was returning 404 errors.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Fixed endpoint routing and server process management
- Added proper server shutdown before new deployments
- Enhanced deployment script with process cleanup

**Result:** ✅ Visual deployment confirmation page now working at `/deployment-status`
